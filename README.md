# yaxxxay

Yaxxxay is a programming language. It is transpiled into C++ code.

## Motivation
c++ is a very powerful and elegant multi paradigm language. It has powerful and elegant concepts and currently the language its improving fast. Considering the origin and the similarity to the C programming language. The first compilers for c++ was a transpiler to C.

While one of the strength of c++ was its similarity to C, which allows for a smooth transition from C to C++, this becomes also a weakness more and more.

Yaxxxay follows a lot of the C++ paradigms, but there are also some differences.

 - Generics are explicit not best match
 - Classes are either leafs (so called concrete) or inner classes (so calles extension) . So a class is either used to be derivated from or a final class, never both (but it's simple to just make the final derivation on a inner class)
 - There is no function overloading.
